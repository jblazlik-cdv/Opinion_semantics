happy:
So interesting to able to see what lava left behind and the so many different colours of the rocks! Our guide was amazing! She explained everything in detail and made the walking your something to remember!

Very personal and immersive experience with a knowledgeable guide. Highly recommend. Not too strenuous, be sure to upgrade your tour if you want to do some climbing.


Not happy:
The main criticism I have is the ratio between the expensive price and the activity which was nice but not more than that and definitely not worth 60 USD per person not even half of this would be reasonable for a barely one hour tour!

I accidentally booked the tour without transportation, when I found out I tried to change my tour. But it was within 24 hrs, so I contacted them and they told me I had to re-book a tour with transportation and a refund would be given. I later found out that refunds aren't given if your booking is under 24 hrs. I didn't like how The Lava Tunnel told me to re-book knowing I wouldn't get a refund. Granted I made the mistake initially, but I also made the same mistake booking the Golden Circle tour but Greyline tours simply switched my tour to accommodate me. Needless to say, I didn't make it to the lava tunnel tour.
